# Private Server Down Detector

This tool is scanning the entire `database.json` file, which contains all topics in the private servers category, along
with their associated content.\
The topic post is `HTML code` which is checked with a `regex` to find all valid hrefs links, as well as ignoring those
in the 'ignored urls.json' file to avoid making unnecessary requests.\
The links are then tested with a `HEAD request` to determine whether or not the server is online.\
This will allow us to get rid of the servers that are no longer operational and tidy up the relevant forum category.\
Topics without urls will be archived immediately.

The output features are still being worked on, but the tool is fully functional:
1. [x] Quickly generating a graph of the server statistics:
    + [x] Offline
    + [x] Online
    + [x] ~~Unknown (no urls)~~ **(TODO)**
2. [x] Generating a custom output file with the results of the scan.
3. [x] Constructing an automatic query to move offline servers to the archive category.
